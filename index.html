          <h2>About</h2>
          <p>Most equipment and manufacturing companies face the same problem breaking into federal contracting: compliance feels overwhelming, proposal structures are unclear, and timing rarely aligns with production cycles. That’s where I come in.</p>
          <p>With over 15 years in mechanical engineering, heavy machinery maintenance, and industrial operations, I understand both the shop floor and the contracting process. Now, I help businesses in manufacturing, machinery leasing, and equipment maintenance build federal strategies that turn technical expertise into long-term contracts.</p>

          <ul class="impact-list">
            <li><strong>If your proposals miss the mark</strong> — I <u>bring clarity and structure</u> so your technical strengths translate into compliant, persuasive bids.</li>
            <li><strong>If your business lacks capture focus</strong> — I <u>map the right DoD and State opportunities</u> that match your production and service capacity.</li>
            <li><strong>If your internal systems are ad-hoc</strong> — I <u>turn them into repeatable, auditable workflows</u> that withstand government review.</li>
          </ul>

          <p>I don’t just advise; I align operations, compliance, and capture to help industrial firms scale into federal markets—sustainably.</p>

          <h3>How I Work</h3>
          <ul>
            <li>Identify where your bid, capture, and compliance processes break down.</li>
            <li>Build lean, compliant workflows that integrate with your existing production and maintenance systems.</li>
            <li>Target DoD, VA, and Homeland Security opportunities that require equipment supply, leasing, or maintenance.</li>
            <li>Develop proposals and reporting systems that can withstand technical and compliance audits.</li>
          </ul>

          <p>When industrial companies fall short, I step in to convert operational reliability into federal-winning strategies—so you don’t just compete, you deliver.</p>
